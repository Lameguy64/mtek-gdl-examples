# MTek-GDL Examples
This repository houses all the example programs using the MTek-GDL library. Majority of the examples are written by the same author of the MTek-GDL library but community-made examples are highly welcome.

Some of the latest examples such as shaders are not complete as it is not yet fully commented but is fully functional.

The repository for the MTek-GDL library can be found here:
